# Bounties
*formerly "/rfp"*

These are specifications for work that helps NEAR and the NEAR ecosystem.  The Issues tab will list each of these and their labels will help you search for what you want. 

*This is a work in progress so bear with us :)*
*This currently duplicates some effort with the issues on the [/community repo issues](https://github.com/near/community/issues) as well, which will need to get cleaned up.*

## Overview: Calling Developers, Designers, Product People and Founders!

To help the community better participate in the creation of everything from core infrastructure to design sprints, this repo is designed to surface the key needs discovered by people who are working on the NEAR Project and in its ecosystem.  It is the basic precursor to future Grants Program activities and it is intended to help anyone clearly and transparently participate in meaningful projects that support NEAR.


**These specs are emphatically both technical and non-technical in nature**

Over time, we will better clarify the procedure for defining specs, working on specs, and receiving grants or rewards for delivering on them.


### How to get involved

This is a work in progress!  If you see a spec or RFP pop up here, drop a comment on it or reach out to the maintainer.

If you're not sure what to build, see [this thread of ideas](https://gov.near.org/t/tools-missing-in-the-ecosystem/75/16).

If you do want to build something not on this list, check out the [grants program](https://www.near.org/grants).


### Token rewards

Every spec will be different. Many may not list specific rewards, particularly as we are figuring this out.  Your best path forward is to contact the producer of the spec or comment directly on it so they can engage with you and figure out what will make it worth it.

As always, eligibility requirements will vary for grants and rewards so it's also important to check in on that.  For example, prior the [final phase of MainNet](https://near.org/blog/near-mainnet-genesis/) it will be very challenging to offer token-based rewards in certain geographies.


## Examples

Some examples of potential RFP projects might include large and small, technical and non-technical projects:

1. Another NEAR client implementation, for example in Go
2. A third party wallet integration
3. A user research survey of projects and founders across the ecosystem
4. A design for a sample delegation interface in a wallet
4. A rapid prototyping framework which shows how NEAR is different from other UX flows

See this [development catalog hackpad](https://hackmd.io/@vvNs0QmHR-uhQ4-90rbhlw/BkByX1kbu) for more ideas and examples of what already exists.


## FAQ
### How is building for a Bounty different from addressing a code issue?

If you are a developer, you can get involved directly with the main project repos by going directly to those and checking out the open issues.  The Bounty specs in this repo are intended to involve projects which are not related to existing repos.

### Does this include marketing-style bounties?

No, this only includes bounties that can be claimed by a single use. A listing of broader community bounties will be linked here when available.


### What kinds of tasks should be included here?

Some tasks are large (building a new client) and others are small (translating a blog post).
Some tasks are technical and others are not.
All of these have a home in this repo.


### Who can start a bounty?

Anyone who intends to pay the reward can start a bounty, though bounties which are counter to the high level goals of the project will not be accepted.

2. The main [Contributor Program page](https://near.org/contributor) where you can participate in a wide range of community-focused activities (usually these are more bite-sized than projects in this repo)
2. The [Community coordination repo](https://github.com/near/community) where community activities are coordinated.
3. The [Events Repo](https://github.com/nearprotocol/near-events) where events that team members might sponsor, speak at or host are submitted and tracked
3. Any of the repos in the [NEAR Github](https://github.com/near) will have READMEs listing their contribution process


## TODO

* [x]  Create an issue template to make it easier for people to submit specs, categorize them and otherwise interface with this repo
* [x] Create a Trello board or other project tracking device which better exposes the actual progress of these specs.
* [ ] Clarify the way to onboard with a new spec 
* [ ] Clarify to spec producers how exactly they should put together a spec
* [ ] Clarify the grant/reward process associated with them
* [ ] Make sure everything everywhere links to this -- Contributor Program, website, blog posts, etc as a tangible set of ways to get involved.
